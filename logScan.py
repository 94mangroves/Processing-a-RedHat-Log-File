# The purpose of this script is to search for words or strings in a txt document
# The text document should be in the same folder that this script resides
#
# This scipt will prompt the user for a file to process.
# It will open the file and iterate through each line of the file, catch and report any errors that occur.
# For each line in the file:
# If the line identifies a specific worm that was detected, then record the unique name of the worm.
# Keep track of the number of occurrences of each unique worm.
# Once all the lines have been processed produce a prettytable result that includes the name of each unique worm and number of occurrences that were identified.
# The prettytable will format the results by highest occurring worms
#
#
# Note: the best way I found for this to work is by:
# First, downloading Python in Ubuntu https://phoenixnap.com/kb/how-to-install-python-3-ubuntu
# Second, downloading and installing Wing IDE in Ubuntu https://wingware.com/doc/install/linux-installation-detail
# Third, install PIP on Ubuntu https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-install-pip-on-ubuntu-20.04/
# Fourth, downloading and installing PrettyTables in Ubuntu https://pypi.org/project/prettytable/

# This imports RegEx just in case we don't know the format of the document the user chooses

import re

# This imports PrettyTable, it should be installed locally
